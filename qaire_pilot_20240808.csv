Project Title: Job Tasks and Abilities Questionnaire

You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether to participate it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully. 



What is the purpose of this study?

The aim of this questionnaire is to identify common job tasks that are involved within different sub-divisions of a typical company. We also aim to identify fundamental cognitive abilities necessary to perform these job tasks successfully (e.g., memory, spatial abilities, social abilities etc.) More broadly, we are interested in identifying and safeguarding uniquely human capabilities as AI is becoming increasingly integrated into the workplace.



Do I have to take part?

Taking part is entirely voluntary, and refusal or withdrawal will involve no penalty or loss, now or in the future. You are free to withdraw from the experiment at any time without explaining why. 



What will the study involve?

The study involves a questionnaire about the tasks and abilities that are required for your job. The questionnaire should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.



Are there any possible disadvantages or risks in taking part?

There are no risks involved in taking part in this questionnaire. There is no time limit, and breaks can be taken as required.



Confidentiality – who will have access to my personal data?

Personally identifiable data will not be made available outside of the study team. We will be using any personal information you give us in order to undertake this study and the University of Cambridge will act as the data controller for this purpose. The legal basis for using your personal information is to carry out a task (i.e. academic research) in the public interest. We will keep identifiable information about you only for as long as necessary for the study. Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate.  If you withdraw from the study, we will keep the information about you that we have already obtained. To safeguard your rights, we will do our best to only use the minimum personally-identifiable information possible. 

 

For further general information about the University of Cambridge’s use of your personal data as a participant in a research study, please see https://www.information-compliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/data-protection/research-participant-data.



What will happen to the study results?

Results from groups of individuals, without any means of identifying the individuals involved, may be presented at conferences and written up in journals. Non-identifiable data may be shared with other researchers or the public as part of collaborations, joint projects or open access provisions.



Who is organising the research?

The study is organised in the Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, by Jonathan Prunty. Questions or concerns can be directed to them at jep84@cam.ac.uk. 



Ethics Committee Approval

This project has undergone the review procedure of the Department of Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cambridge.
